ECL 8.9.0:
==========

* Visible changes:

 - The compiler now signals compiler-error, compiler-warning and compiler-note
   for errors, warnings and notes, respectively.

 - Printing of compiler messages is now ruled by *COMPILE-PRINT*, *COMPILE-VERBOSE*
   and *SUPPRESS-COMPILER-MESSAGES*. The latter is either NIL or a valid lisp type
   which denotes which compiler messages are suppressed. If *SUPPRESS-COMPILER-MESSAGES*
   is NIL and *COMPILE-VERBOSE* is NIL, then no messages are shown.

 - *SUPPRESS-COMPILER-NOTES* and *SUPPRES-COMPILER-WARNINGS* are deprecated and
   will be removed in next release.

 - ECL allows the user to set up handlers for different compiler conditions,
   including errors, warnings and simple notes. The recommended procedure is to
   use HANDLER-BIND and _NOT_ to transfer control out of the compilation
   environment, but to defer to the default handlers or use the restarts ABORT
   and MUFFLE-WARNING.

	(use-package :c)
	(let ((warnings nil))
	  (handler-bind ((compiler-message #'(lambda (c)
					       (push c warnings))))
	    (compile-file "foo.lsp" :verbose nil :print nil))
	  (format t "~&;;; Printing compiler messages")
	  (loop for m in (nreverse warnings)
	     for i from 0
	     do (format t "~&~@<;;; ~@;Message #~D~%~A~:>" i m)))

 - In windows, ECL recognizes the environment variables HOMEDRIVE and HOMEPATH
   and uses them to construct the output of user-homedir-pathname.

 - We switch to an Ubuntu-like versioning system, based on $(year).$(month).x
   where "x" is 0 for a release or any higher number for a patched version.

 - In Unix-type systems, ECL now installs with a "soname" and using versioned
   directory names, such as /usr/lib/ecl-8.9.0, /usr/lib/libecl.so.8.9, etc

 - New configuration flag, --without-fpe, to disable floating point exception
   code in platforms that have buggy implementations of feenableexcept().

* Bugs fixed:

 - The optimizer for COERCE might enter an infinite loop for certain
   type intervals.

 - The sharp macros #n# and #n=... did not work well with arrays of an
   specialized type.

 - Deactivate --enable-asmapply by default, because it is still an experimental
   feature.

 - In compiled files, externalize package objects using FIND-PACKAGE.

 - In RUN-PROGRAM, there were two bugs: first, the keyword :WAIT was not
   defined in the C core and caused an error when used; second, if the output
   stream was missing or directed to the standard output, it would fail.

 - SI:LOAD-FOREIGN-MODULE does not coerce the library name to a truename
   before loading. Instead, it leaves this task to the appropriate routine,
   dlopen or similar.

 - Bytecode objects created inside an eval-when had an invalid name.

 - SI:LOAD-FOREIGN-MODULE now relies on dlopen/LibraryLoad/... to find the
   foreign libraries. Nevertheless, duplicate libraries are still identified
	> (si::load-foreign-module "libm.dylib")
	#<codeblock "libm.dylib">
	> (si::load-foreign-module "/usr/lib/libm.dylib")
	#<codeblock "libm.dylib">

 - In reading functions, the value of :RECURSIVE-P should not interfere with
   that of :EOF-ERROR-P.

 - The MSVC port can be built with support for unicode characters.

 - PROCLAIM/DECLAIM now understand the abbreviated form of type declarations
   user-defined and complex types.

 - The compiler did not understand the :UNSIGNED-SHORT/:SHORT FFI types
   completely.

 - Sharp-dot macro reader (#.) gets its own sharp-equal context (#=) so that
   the following form
	(read-from-string "'#.(princ (list '#1=(1 2) '#1#))")
   actually prints the right list (#1=(1 2) #1#).

 - Inline/not-inline declarations for SETF-functions are not ignored (Josh
   Elsasser).

 - When a SETF place is a macro, it has to be expanded with MACROEXPAND-1.

 - In FTYPE proclamations and declarations, the type may now be a user defined
   function type (Josh Elsasser).
