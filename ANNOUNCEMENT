Announcement of ECL v0.9j
=========================

ECL stands for Embeddable Common-Lisp. The ECL project aims to produce
an implementation of the Common-Lisp language which complies to the ANSI
X3J13 definition of the language.

The term embeddable refers to the fact that ECL includes a lisp to C
compiler, which produces libraries (static or dynamic) that can be
called from C programs. Furthermore, ECL can produce standalone
executables from your lisp code and can itself be linked to your
programs as a shared library.

ECL supports the operating systems Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD,
Solaris (at least v. 9), Microsoft Windows and OSX, running on top of
the Intel, Sparc, Alpha and PowerPC processors. Porting to other
architectures should be rather easy.

ECL is currently hosted at Common-Lisp.net and SourceForge. The home
page of the project is http://ecls.sourceforge.net, and in it you will
find source code releases, a CVS tree and some useful documentation.


Notes for this release
======================

This is mostly a bugfix release, but it includes several interesting
new features, such as the SERVE-EVENT package, ported from SBCL by
Steve Smith, finalization of lisp objects and installation of ECL
on standard unix paths
